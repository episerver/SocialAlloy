# Tutorials

The tutorials are are meant to be simple implementations of some typical use cases of 
social features. They are not necessarily well designed and are meant to very simplistically
illustrate using the EPiServer Social features to implement such use cases.
For more structured uses of the social features please refer to the code up one level from 
this folder.  Since we're plugging the tutorial code into the Social Alloy site, we use
a very simple EPiServer Block implemenation to do that.
